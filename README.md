# Corvus Links

## Purpose

* Link an arbitrary location within a text document to another text location
* Navigate to and from these links via the UI

## Add, Edit, Remove

To add, end, or remove a link, press `Control`
(Windows and Linux) or `Command` (Mac) + `L`, release, and then press (no shift needed):

* `A` for adding a link or un-ending / continuing an existing link
* `E` for ending a chain of links
* `R` for removing a link

For example, to add a link on Mac: press and release `Command + L` and then press `A`

## Navigate

To navigate a link, press `Control` / `Command` and then:

* `[` to go to the previous / "from" / backwards links
* `]` to go to the next / "to" / forwards links

And then select the link in the pop-up dialog.

Note: this overrides Eclipse's default forward / back navigation.
